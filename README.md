   Parkinson’s Disease is a neurodegenerative disease that affects millions of people around the world. The symptoms are debilitating, including loss of motor coordination, hallucination, and memory loss. By the time these symptoms manifest, usually in the patients’ later years of life, patients have already incurred significant brain damage. Early diagnosis and prediction are crucial to mitigating the brain cell damage and alleviating the suffering of patients. Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning have shown potential in the field of medicine, especially with early diagnosis. 
     
   This project utilized different Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning Algorithms to predict the risk of Parkinson’s Disease based on clinical data. Artificial Neural Network(ANN), K-Nearest Neighbor(KNN), Naive Bayes(Gaussian and Multinomial), and Random Forest algorithms were chosen based on their effectiveness in general classification problems. In this project, these algorithms were tested on a dataset that related the diagnosis of Parkinsons’ Disease with data about physical and mental symptoms, the occurrence of Parkinson’s in specific family members, and familial history of different diseases. The parameters and structures of the algorithms were optimized to perform best with the given data.  An accuracy threshold of 85% was selected as a success criterion for the algorithms. 
     
   Experimental results showed that ANN and Random Forest both reached accuracies above the threshold, KNN came close, but both Gaussian and Multinomial Naive Bayes were unsuccessful. ANN had the best accuracy of 87.9%, followed by Random Forest with an accuracy of 87.2% and KNN with an accuracy of 84.4%. This could be attributed to ANN‘s learning capabilities and flexible structure. This project establishes that Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning can be successfully employed to predict Parkinson’s Disease based on clinical data. Further research should be done to investigate techniques to improve prediction accuracy. Enhanced machine algorithms, such as Convolutional Neural Network(CNN) can be investigated. These algorithms should also be tested on different, independent datasets to validate their effectiveness.
